 * ukrainan and certain other macros are replaced for each language;
 *
 * Note: this file is read in single-user -j mode, which means that the
 * command terminator is semicolon-newline-newline; whenever the backend
 * sees that, it stops and executes what it's got.  If you write a lot of
 * statements without empty lines between, they'll all get quoted to you
 * in any error message about one of them, so don't do that.  Also, you
 * cannot write a semicolon immediately followed by an empty line in a
 * string literal (including a function body!) or a multiline comment.
